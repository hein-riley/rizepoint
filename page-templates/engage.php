		<p>Bootcamps are back for Engage 2018 and they’re better than ever. We incorporated your feedback from last year, and have come back with mix-and-match bootcamps covering a wide range of needs and experience levels. Plus, bootcamp attendance is included free in the cost of your registration!</p>
		<p>Take advantage of a full day of in-depth product training on Feb. 6 before the main conference begins. This year we’ve created two tracks: Core Features, which will cover primary product functionality and best practice information and refreshers; and Maximize Value, which will help you uncover hidden gems or underused tools within your implementation, in addition to deep dives on features. Decide which topics and experience levels best serve your needs by building your own schedule throughout the day. And the popular Mobile Auditor scavenger hunt is back—this time bringing together all bootcamp attendees for a one-of-a-kind experience!</p>
